### Financial Model for Tarang Netra.

#### **Executive Summary**

Tarang Netra is a cognitive early-warning ecosystem creating a real-time "Digital Twin" of India's coastline. This model projects the financial requirements and a dual-stream revenue strategy based on **direct data subscriptions** and **licensed API access**. By monetizing its unique, validated data through a B2B/B2G model, Tarang Netra can achieve financial sustainability while fulfilling its primary mission of public safety. The initial funding sought is **₹75 Lakhs** for development and pilot deployment, with a projected payback period of **less than 18 months**, driven by the high value of its preventative intelligence and future data-as-a-service revenue.

#### **Key Assumptions**

*   **Phased Rollout:** Year 1 focuses on pilot deployment and data validation. Commercial API and data services launch in Year 2.
*   **Dual Revenue Stream:** Revenue begins in Year 2, sourced from both direct data sales (e.g., historical reports, risk assessments) and recurring fees from API licensing for real-time data integration.
*   **Revenue Growth:** Total revenue is projected to grow by 150% in Year 3 as the network expands, data quality improves, and more enterprise clients subscribe to the API.
*   **Operational Costs (OPEX):** Includes cloud infrastructure, a core team for AI/data management, and program support. Projected to increase by 25% annually to support scaling.
*   **Funding:** The model assumes the full initial CAPEX of ₹75 Lakhs is secured as initial seed funding.

#### **Revenue & Funding Metrics Breakdown**

*   **Annual Grant/Funding Target: ₹20-25 Lakhs+**
    The primary initial income source will be government grants and CSR funding to cover CAPEX and initial OPEX.

*   **Projected Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) from Data Services:**
    This is the core of the commercial strategy, broken down into two streams:
    1.  **Data Marketplace (Direct Subscriptions):** Provides curated datasets, historical analysis, and risk assessment reports to clients like researchers, urban planners, and consultants.
    2.  **API Licensing Fees:** Provides real-time, validated coastal data directly into client systems. This is the primary growth driver, targeting high-value enterprise clients.

*   **API Licensing - Illustrative Tiered Pricing Structure:**
    *   **Developer/Researcher Tier:** A free or low-cost plan with a limited number of API calls per month to encourage innovation and academic use.
    *   **Business Tier (e.g., ₹40,000/month):** Designed for businesses with moderate data needs, offering a higher API call limit and standard support.
    *   **Enterprise Tier (e.g., ₹2-5 Lakhs/month):** Custom, high-volume plans for large corporations (insurance, logistics) and other government departments, including service level agreements (SLAs) and dedicated support.
    *   *Calculation:* The projected **₹50 Lakhs** in Year 3 could be achieved with just 8-10 enterprise clients at the lower end of the enterprise pricing tier, demonstrating the model's viability.

*   **Licensing Fee (Technology Export):**
    A future revenue stream from licensing the entire A-SaaS (Aatmanirbhar Software as a Service) framework to other nations, with potential for significant one-time or recurring fees.

---

#### **Key Performance & Growth Metrics**

*   **Projected Revenue CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate): 150%**
    Driven by the scaling of the high-value API licensing model from Year 2 to Year 3.
*   **Payback Period: 12-18 Months**
    The project's value is realized first through averted disaster costs. The financial payback period is achieved as ARR from data and API services ramps up.
*   **Break-Even Point:** The project is projected to achieve operational profitability in Year 3.
*   **Net Profit Margin (Year 3): ~48%**
    Demonstrates the high scalability and strong financial potential of the data-as-a-service model once the initial platform investment is made.

## Sources of Assumptions

### *Government Funding & Disaster Management Context*
*   *Source 1: National and State Disaster Mitigation Funds (NDMF & SDMF)*
    *   *Information:* The financial model's reliance on government grants is supported by the existence of substantial, dedicated funds for disaster management in India. In a Press Information Bureau (PIB) release, the Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation, Shri Amit Shah, announced the establishment of a ₹8,000 crore fund for flood mitigation and detailed the allocations for the SDRF and NDMF. For the period 2021-26, the central government has allocated ₹13,693 crore for the NDMF and ₹32,031 crore for the SDMF.
    *   *Link/Reference:* Press Information Bureau (PIB), Government of India. "Scheme of an amount of over Rs. 8000 crore for flood mitigation approved under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi." (June 13, 2023).

*   *Source 2: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in India*
    *   *Information:* The model's suggestion of tapping into CSR funds is based on Indian corporate law. Under the Companies Act, 2013, companies meeting certain financial thresholds are required to spend 2% of their average net profits on CSR activities. "Disaster relief" is explicitly listed as a permissible activity under Schedule VII of the Act, making A-SaaS a prime candidate for corporate funding.
    *   *Link/Reference:* Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India. The Companies Act, 2013, Section 135 and Schedule VII.

### *Market Data & Revenue Projections*

*   *Source 3: India Insurance Analytics Market Growth*
    *   *Information:* The projection of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) from selling data to the insurance sector is validated by strong market growth. A market research report by Fact.MR projects the India insurance analytics market to reach a valuation of US$ 1,570.6 million by 2033, expanding at a robust CAGR of 14.8%. This indicates a significant and growing demand from insurance companies for the kind of hyper-granular risk data that A-SaaS would produce.
    *   *Link/Reference:* Fact.MR. "India Insurance Analytics Market." (Accessed September 2025).

*   *Source 4: Data Broker Market Size and Growth*
    *   *Information:* The concept of a "National Ocean Data Marketplace" is supported by the large and expanding global data broker market. Reports from industry analysts like Statista show the global data broker market size is substantial and forecast to grow significantly, highlighting the commercial value of curated, high-quality data.
    *   *Link/Reference:* Statista. "Data Broker Market Size Worldwide from 2023 to 2030." (Accessed September 2025).

### *Technology Costs & Licensing*

*   *Source 5: Technology Development Costs in India*
    *   *Information:* The estimated CAPEX of ₹65-75 Lakhs is a realistic figure for medium-complexity software and hardware R&D in India. While exact figures vary, numerous software development agencies and industry reports in India quote costs for complex platform development ranging from ₹40 Lakhs to over ₹1 Crore, placing the A-SaaS estimate well within a reasonable range.
    *   *Link/Reference:* This is based on aggregated data from various Indian technology consulting and software development firms' public pricing guides and industry reports.

*   *Source 6: Standard Technology Licensing & Royalty Rates*
    *   *Information:* The revenue stream from licensing the A-SaaS framework internationally is based on standard business practices. Research on intellectual property valuation shows that royalty rates for patented technology and software can range widely, but often fall between 3% and 15%. This confirms that technology export is a viable and potentially lucrative revenue model.
    *   *Link/Reference:* World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) publications and various business journals on technology transfer and licensing provide general guidelines on royalty rate negotiations.
